Quiz wars is a web app for users who want to test their JavaScript knowledge. This app is a short, timed quiz, which lets the user know if they were right or wrong immediately after answering each question. The app subtracts seconds off the clock for each incorrect answer, and at the end- you are given a score! Play multiple times to try to beat your high-score and rank first on the leaderboard!

Quiz Wars uses DOM API methods to handle events such as key presses and mouse clicks, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. High scores are stored in local storage, and a timer function sets time-based events (ex. Game Over when the clock runs down).
